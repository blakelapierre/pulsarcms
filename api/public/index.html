  <h1>POWERED BY MEAN</h1>
  <p>
    The PureTech API Foundation and Pulsar CMS are powered by the MEAN stack. The system's back-end API is built using MongoDB, Node.js, ExpressJS and Mongoose. The front ends are powered by AngularJS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes. Front ends. Plural. There is a blog-like front end and one that's been custom-tailored for delivering music and other interactive media.
  </p>

  <h2>PULSAR<img src="favicon.ico" style="position:relative; top: -16px;" /> API</h2>
  <p>
    The Pulsar API is powered by:
    <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>,
    <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>,
    <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">MongooseJS</a> and
    <a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>. It is a standalone system written in JavaScript on Node.js that does not require a client to do work. Pulsar clients require this API in order to do any work and will not operate without access to at least one Pulsar API instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Pulsar API provides a range of services to a variety of clients. These can be browser clients (desktop and/or mobile), mobile clients running a web frame in an app, a native SDK mobile client accessing the service through custom software or anything else, really. Before long, I hope some sort of Raspberry Pi or Cubieboard will be controlling the lights on the side of a building to spell out micropulses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Pulsar API is able to be used by anyone anywhere. You just have to be able to authenticate to Pulsar (log in). Once you have an HTTP session, you can create, retrieve, update and delete pulses, micropulses, comments and more. Want to integrate your pulses directly into your existing blog? No problem. That is specifically what the Pulsar API is for, and it's how the current Pulsar client does literally everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will eventually the Pulsar API documentation being served directly from the Pulsar API server itself.
  </p>

  <h2>PULSAR<img src="favicon.ico" style="position:relative; top: -16px;" /> FRONT END</h2>
  <p>
    Pulsar does have an official front end powered by
    <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. It is a standalone HTML5 Single-Page Application (SPA) built as an example of what's possible using the Pulsar API and the PureTech API application development framework.
