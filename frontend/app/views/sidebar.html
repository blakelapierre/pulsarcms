    My name is Rob Colbert. I created Pulsar. Then, I used it to create
    this blog. Now, you're here. Why? I'm probably going to ask. Have an
    answer.

    Hi, kids! Here's something fun to try: Press play on this 43-minute
    <strong>trap</strong> mix, and go use my whole site. As you navigate
    from page to page, realize that this sidebar isn't reloading. The music
    isn't pausing and reloading. Right about then...yeah...that's when it
    kinda hits you in your 3rd eye: These fuckers are <em>crazy</em>, and
    this site was probably built using Voodoo.
