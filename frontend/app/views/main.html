    Pulsar is a brand-new content management system being built with one very
    important primary concern: High-Quality user experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pulsar is built on the <a href="http://mean.io">MEAN stack</a>, and my
    intention is to keep it simple. I am just getting started.

    And, yes. That <em>is</em> a responsive embedded YouTube video with a
    drop shadow and text flowing freely around it on a tablet, phone, desktop
    PC or movie projector. You don't "theme" Pulsar. You build a client of
    your own, if you want.

<h1>Sample Blog</h1>
<p>
  This is a sample of a blog built with Pulsar. The data model and API already
  support likes and dislikes. I'm working on the UI for those. Comments are
  implemented. Open any post and scroll down. No need to create an account or
  login to comment on a post. I have other ways of preventing spam. Just enjoy
  the blog and feel free to leave some feedback. This is intended to be a
  discsussion and not just a demonstration of what Pulsar can do.
