  Pulsar is an entirely new direction in content management systems. It
  is also an entirely new direction in social networking. It also offers
  the most advanced presentation system and content creation tools of
  any CMS available. Pulsar can be hosted on modest hardware, is very
  easy to set up, use and maintain and is just getting started.

  It's all being created and freely given away to prove whether the MEAN
  stack is ready for large-scale work. And, that's being done so I can
  finally zip the lips of "IT Professionals" who have no idea what they
  are talking about and have found themselves on my bad side.

  Pulsar is similar to blogging software. But, instead of posts, Pulsar
  creates pulses. Pulses range from static documents similar to standard
  blog posts created in Pulsar Composer to highly interactive, dynamic
  video games and other applications created in Pulsar Studio. Watch
  <a href="/#/moving-parts">Moving Parts</a>, an work-in-progress example
  of what Pulsar Studio can already do. Then, have a look at
  <a href="/#/prototype">Prototype</a>, a finished example of what Pulsar
  Composer can do.

<p>
  Pulsar  is so open and modular that you can build your own applications
  against the Pulsar API server using nothing more than your web browser,
  and actually have every feature of Pulsar integrated into whatever
  you're building (a Composer document or a Studio application).

<p>
  From personal blogs to news sites to music sites to online games to
  enterprise applications of all types, Pulsar wants to be a technology
  you can use to quickly meet your content and website management goals.
  It is easy to deploy, easy to maintain, handles remarkable levels of
  traffic and scale and sits atop some of the best modern technology.
