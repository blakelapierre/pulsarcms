<h2>What Is This?</h2>

<p>
  You are on a web site operated by
  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/robcolbert">Rob Colbert</a>, a veteran
  full-stack to low-level network and "Web" software developer. It is running
  his personal software project: Pulsar. The YouTube video above shows Pulsar
  doing what it does. If you have Google Chrome, find it under
  Demos -> Moving Parts.
</p>

<p>
  The public is welcomed to participate on a variety of levels. The fastest and
  most helpful way is to create a test account and post content here. As you do,
  feel free to share any feedback you might have. Another way to get involved is
  to install Pulsar and run your own instance. A valid use of Pulsar would be as
  a family's personal server to share photos with friends and family without the
  advertising and privacy violations and incessant game invites of Facebook.
</p>

<p>
  Pulsar is similar to blogging software. But, instead of posts, Pulsar
  creates pulses. Pulses range from static documents similar to standard
  blog posts created in Pulsar Composer to highly interactive, dynamic
  video games and other applications created in Pulsar Studio. Watch
  <a href="/#/moving-parts">Moving Parts</a>, a work-in-progress example
  of what Pulsar Studio can already do. Next, have a look at
  <a href="/#/prototype">Prototype</a>, a finished example of what Pulsar
  Studio can do.
</p>

<p>
  Pulsar is distributed under the
  <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> open source license.
  You are entirely free to have and use Pulsar in whatever way you see fit.
  Build your own applications that run directly in Pulsar against using
  nothing more than your web browser and Pulsar Composer or Pulsar Studio.
</p>

<p>
  From personal blogs to news sites to music sites to online games to
  web applications of all types, Pulsar wants to be a technology you can use to
  quickly meet your content creation and website management goals. It is easy to
  deploy, very easy to maintain, handles remarkable levels of traffic with no
  single points of failure end-to-end and sits atop some of the best modern
  technology that money <em>can't</em> buy.
</p>

<p>
  Pulsar even has a Dislike button. You just can't see it, yet, because I'm
  still building the earliest of features in the UI. If it's too early, I
  understand. But, stop back each week. You'll see :)
