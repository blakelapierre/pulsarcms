  Welcome to Pulsar!
  <small>
    Other CMS vendors are on notice. Your reign of terror over content
    creators, application developers and data center managers is now officially
    coming to a rapid and abrupt close. Thank you for your service. You moved the
    whole Internet in some interesting new directions. But...

    Consider: Pulsar. It is a brand-new content management system being built
    against one important primary concern: Quality user experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pulsar is built on the <a href="http://mean.io">MEAN stack</a>. And, it is
    practically a guarnatee that it's already more technologically advanced than
    whatever you're likely to be using at the moment. And, I am just getting
    started. <a href="/#/posts/530b060b1c40eec960000007">Learn more...</a>

    That is a responsive YouTube video with a drop shadow and text flowing freely
    around it on a tablet, phone, desktop PC or movie projector. Because, well, I
    guess I just want to be left alone here with my post-apocalyptic zombie dubstep
    violin music to create the most advanced CMS engine you've ever seen
    <em>and</em> an online service to go with it. It's entirely about you and your
    experience no matter who "you" are. I guess I'm inviting "you" to watch and
    participate wait while I write the JavaScript backing code required to make
    that video's drop shadow pulse with the bass in the music.

    I type fast. Gimme a minute. I'm trying to break the Internet, and I'm really
    picky about my soundtrack while I'm doing it. Yes, I am having fun with this
    while hoping you are, too. And, soon, you can create an account and start
    exploring here.

<h1>Sample Blog</h1>
<p>
  It's called a sample blog because it's the one that ships with Pulsar when you
  first install it. BUT, you can build one that works differently. You're not
  restricted to simply <em>theming</em> Pulsar. You can entirely build your own
  client with your own features. This is my client. It's also the one I share in
  the forthcoming open source version of Pulsar and the one that will be offered
  by the forthcoming Constellation online service. Your blog, however, can be
  quite different. Quite.
