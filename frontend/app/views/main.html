      Pulsar is a cross between a Content Management System and an application
      development platform. It helps people create and communicate. The easiest
      way to get involved and help push Pulsar forward is to create a profile,
      have a look around, post new content here to see how Pulsar works and then
      tell people you think should know about it. Here's step one:
    </p>
    <div class="cta-button-container text-center">
      <a href="/#/signup"
         class="btn btn-default btn-lg cta-button"
         >
        Create Profile
      </a>

    <h2>Pulsar Helps People Create and Communicate</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Pulsar has two primary jobs: Help people create and communicate more effectively while staying entirely out of their way. The basic philosophy is for Pulsar to be helpful while not being irritating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you already creating online? Do you know someone who is? Are you/they
      frustrated with "online in general, fuck this shit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm just saying: Pulsar might be worth exploring. It's an easier
      <em>and</em> more technologically advanced way to manage your stuff online
      and keep in touch/share with those who matter most to you. Period. That can
      be your immediate family or your world-wide audience of fans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bloggers, music and video producers, talk show hosts and pretty much anyone
      out there with something to say or do either professionally or as a hobby
      <em>should</em> already be looking at Pulsar. If you know a creative person
      who struggles with "online bullshit" (you'll know if you do), please send
      them my way. I'd love to talk about how Pulsar can specifically help them.

    <h2>What Else Have You Done?</h2>
    <img class="img pull-left" src="images/sublogic-robot.jpg" alt="subLOGIC.fm - hear music. support artists. simple." style="margin:16px; width:96px; height:96px;" />
    <p>
      I am the former owner of subLOGIC.fm, a California-based dubstep blog that used to feature some of the best electronic dance music on Earth with live Internet broadcasts. Five years later, and Pulsar is my current effort. This is what I was trying to create back when. The technologies have all improved. And, if you want the absolute best experience on this site (until later), you're already using Google Chrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time around, I'm focusing 100% of my energy and effort on the technology while using that energy to build a platform for artists and creative people world-wide to use to their maximum benefit. And, I'm building the technology for free as well as simply giving it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also spend about 16 years as a professional video game developer working at Sony Computer Entertainment of America, Electronic Arts/Maxis (Darkspore), 2K Sports. In enterprise, I've worked at Google, VMware, and Cisco Systems. I've learned that I'm completely allergic to overly corporate environments. I think that's because I like to create.

    <h2>How Does That Stuff Apply Here?</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      This widget requires
      <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> for the full/best
      experience. Your mileage may vary in different browsers, mobile, etc. This
      is a demonstration of just how far Pulsar can push a browser today.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is an example of Pulsar's built-in SoundCloud player widget.
      This is not the SoundCloud widget - it's custom Pulsar code. Using Pulsar
      Composer's in-place editor, you just put the cursor where you want the
      sound and click the SoundCloud button in the tool bar. Paste the URL and
      you're done. They look and work like this.
    </p>

    <pulsar:soundcloud-player
      data-sound-url="https://soundcloud.com/edm/sick-wid-it-by-virus-syndicate"
      ng-controller="PulsarSoundCloudPlayerCtrl"
      ></pulsar:soundcloud-player>

    <h3>What Are You Seeing?</h3>
    <p class="lead">That's not a screenshot. Press play and go fullscreen.</p>
    <p>
      That is an HTML5 presentation styled with CSS3. No third-party plugins are
      in use. That is not the SoundCloud "widget", but it does use the
      SoundCloud API to stream audio directly into the Web Audio API. From
      there, the audio is decomposed into separate left/right streams and
      analyzed for a variety of information. Bass is separated into "red",
      midrange frequencies are separated into "green" and high-frequency audio
      is separated out into "blue". A 2D &lt;canvas&gt; element is used to
      render the audio frequency spectrum analyzer and time domain waveform
      analyzer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "code" to embed the Pulsar SoundCloud audio player into a pulse is:
    </p>

<pre style="width:100%; overflow:auto;"><code language="language-html">&lt;pulsar:soundcloud-player
  data-sound-url="https://soundcloud.com/edm/sick-wid-it-by-virus-syndicate"
  ng-controller="PulsarSoundCloudPlayerCtrl"
  &gt;&lt;/pulsar:soundcloud-player&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>
      The fullscreen player (hit the fullscreen button) additionally uses WebGL
      to implement a full 3D music visualizer. The primary audio frequency powers (bass, mids and treble) are being used to modulate a variety of parameters in the control logic of the 3D scene. The size of the Starlight is controlled along X for bass, Y for mids and Z for treble (colored red, green and blue, respectively). The Starlight also emits light with an RGB mix that matches the audio frequency powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Starlight visualizer runs at 60fps on modest hardware without using a single plugin. It's just the browser. The browser is only running Pulsar. Pulsar is using Web Audio, WebGL/Three.js, &lt;canvas&gt; and a ton of JavaScript. End of story.

    <h2>GET STARTED!</h2>
    <p>
      I know. Yet another account? Yet another password? Yet another identity
      to manage online? Why can't it just take my Facebook, Twitter or Google
      credentials?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulsar's goal while helping people create and communicate is to allow
      them the exciting freedom that comes along with actually owning your
      own data. Thus, no, Pulsar does not want to communicate with 3rd-party
      authentication service providers. It doesn't want them to know when
      you're using it.

      Whenever you're ready:

    <div class="cta-button-container text-center">
