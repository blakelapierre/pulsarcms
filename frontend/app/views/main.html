  <h1><img src="favicon.ico" /> How Is Pulsar Different or Better?</h1>
  <p>
    Watch <a href="/#/moving-parts">Moving Parts</a>. Then, have a look
    at <a href="/#/prototype">Prototype</a>. Those links should say
    everything that's needed for now to help answer how Pulsar is
    different from any other blogging and content management systems. It
    is so open and modular that you can build your own applications
    against the Pulsar API server, and have every feature of Pulsar
    integrated into whatever you're building.
  </p>
  <p>
    From personal blogs to news sites to music sites to online games to
    enterprise applications of all types, Pulsar wants to be a technology
    you can use to quickly meet your content and website management goals.
    It is easy to deploy, easy to maintain, handles remarkable levels of
    traffic and scale and sits atop some of the best modern technology.
