    Pulsar is a cross between a Content Management System and an application
    development platform. It helps people create. The audio player above is
    not a SoundCloud embedded player. That is the Pulsar presentation engine
    building one for you. It can look and feel however you want.
  </p>
  <p>
    The easiest way to get involved and help push Pulsar forward is to create
    a profile, have a look around and post new content here to see how Pulsar
    works.

  The following is an example of Pulsar's built-in SoundCloud player. All you
  need to embed one or more SoundCloud sound(s) into your pulses is the URL
  of the sound that you would share on social media. Using Pulsar Composer's
  in-place editor, you just put the cursor where you want the sound and click
  the SoundCloud button in the tool bar. Paste the URL and you're done. They
  look and work like this (anywhere - sidebar, main pulses, conversations...
  anywhere)

<script type="text/javascript">
  var container = $('.jumbotron');
  var button = $('.cta-button');
  container.hover(
    function ( ) { button.addClass('hover'); },
    function ( ) { button.removeClass('hover'); }
  );
