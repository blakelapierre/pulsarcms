      Pulsar is a cross between a Content Management System and an application development platform. It helps people create and communicate.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      The easiest way to get involved and help push Pulsar forward is to create a profile, have a look around, post new content here to see how Pulsar works and then tell people you think should know about it. Here's step one:

    <h2>Pulsar Helps People Create and Communicate</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Pulsar has two primary jobs: Help people create and communicate more effectively while staying entirely out of their way. The basic philosophy is for Pulsar to be helpful while not being irritating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you already creating online? Do you know someone who is? Are you/they frustrated with online in general? Did social media not deliver for you like you thought it would? Do you entirely struggle with social media because you find it too difficult to manage one account to do everything? Or, do you find the experience of social media entirely too limiting? 140 characters? Draconian content policies prohibiting boobies (even the breastfeeding ones)?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulsar might be worth exploring. It's an easier <em>and</em> more technologically advanced way to manage your stuff online and keep in touch and share with those who matter most to you.

    <h2>What Else Have You Done?</h2>
    <img class="img pull-left" src="images/sublogic-robot.jpg" alt="subLOGIC.fm - hear music. support artists. simple." style="margin:16px; width:96px; height:96px;" />
    <p>
      I was the creator of subLOGIC.fm, a California-based Dubstep/EDM blog that used to feature some of the best electronic dance music on Earth with live Internet broadcasts. Five years later, and Pulsar is my current effort. This time around, I'm focusing 100% of my effort on the technology to build a platform for creative people world-wide to use to its maximum benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent about 16 years as a professional video game developer working at Sony Computer Entertainment of America, Electronic Arts/Maxis, 2K Sports, Infogrames, MicroProse and others. Then, I spent a little over four years in enterprise software development working at companies like Google, VMware, Cisco Systems and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little over 20 total years trying to be okay with "how we do things around here" and failing miserably, I've learned that I'm basically incompatible with overly corporate environments. And, I guess that's because I just like to create and I can't tolerate bullshit.

    <h2>What's the Coolest Thing Pulsar Currently Does?</h2>
    <p>
      The following is an example of Pulsar's built-in SoundCloud player widget. This is not the SoundCloud widget - it's custom Pulsar code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using Pulsar Composer's in-place editor, you just put the cursor where you want the sound, click the SoundCloud button in the toolbar, paste the URL and publish the pulse. This Pulsar SoundCloud Player is the result:
    </p>

    <pulsar:soundcloud-player
      data-sound-url="https://soundcloud.com/edm/sick-wid-it-by-virus-syndicate"
      ng-controller="PulsarSoundCloudPlayerCtrl"
      ></pulsar:soundcloud-player>

    <p class="help-block">
      This widget requires
      <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> for the full/best experience. Your mileage may vary in different browsers, mobile, etc. This is a demonstration of just how far Pulsar can push a browser today. Last I checked, yes, it works on Android in Chrome including the WebGL fullscreen visualizer if your hardware supports it.
    </p>

    <h3>What Are You Seeing?</h3>
    <p class="lead">That's not a screenshot. Press play and go fullscreen.</p>
    <p>
      That is an HTML5 presentation styled with CSS3. No third-party plugins are in use. That is not the SoundCloud "widget", but it does use the SoundCloud API to stream audio directly into the Web Audio API. From there, the audio is decomposed into separate left/right streams and analyzed for a variety of information. Bass is separated into "red", midrange frequencies are separated into "green" and high-frequency audio is separated out into "blue". A 2D &lt;canvas&gt; element is used to render the audio frequency spectrum analyzer and time domain waveform analyzer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "code" to embed the Pulsar SoundCloud audio player into a pulse is:
    </p>

<pre style="width:100%; overflow:auto;"><code language="language-html">&lt;pulsar:soundcloud-player
  data-sound-url="https://soundcloud.com/edm/sick-wid-it-by-virus-syndicate"
  ng-controller="PulsarSoundCloudPlayerCtrl"
  &gt;&lt;/pulsar:soundcloud-player&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>
      The fullscreen player (hit the fullscreen button) additionally uses WebGL
      to implement a full 3D music visualizer. The primary audio frequency powers (bass, mids and treble) are being used to modulate a variety of parameters in the control logic of the 3D scene. The size of the Starlight is controlled along X for bass, Y for mids and Z for treble (colored red, green and blue, respectively). The Starlight also emits light with an RGB mix that matches the audio frequency powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Starlight visualizer runs at 60fps on modest hardware without using a single plugin. It's just the browser. The browser is only running Pulsar. Pulsar is using Web Audio, WebGL/Three.js, &lt;canvas&gt; and a ton of JavaScript. End of story.

    <h2>Who Should Use Pulsar?</h2>
    <p>
      On some online/social networks, it can genuinely feel like you're being reprimanded by the high school principal for talking without raising your hand, being late or for having to use the bathroom without a hall pass. What is this? Actually high school? The most popular social network is documented as having been basically stolen from a college. So, I guess I get the mentality: These children never left school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern bloggers, music producers, film and video producers, talk show hosts, DJs and MCs and pretty much anyone out there with something to say or do professionally or as a hobby <em>should</em> already be looking at Pulsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you know a creative person who struggles with, "That online bullshit," then please send them my way. I'd love to talk about how Pulsar can specifically help them.
    </p>

    <h2>GET STARTED!</h2>
    <p>
      I know. Yet another account? Yet another password? Yet another identity to manage online? Why can't it just take my Facebook, Twitter or Google credentials?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulsar's goal while helping people create and communicate is to allow them the exciting freedom that comes along with actually owning your own data. Thus, no, Pulsar does not want to communicate with 3rd-party authentication service providers. It doesn't want them to know when you're using it.
