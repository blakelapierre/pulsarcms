      Pulsar is a new way to publish and share online. Pulsar is also an experiment
      trying to prove a few sciencey points here &amp; there about some of the
      technology it uses. But, that won't probably matter much to you.

    <h2>Is This a Beta?</h2>
    <p>
      Pulsar is an Agile software product with continuous integration to
      production. That pretty much means that, from this moment forward,
      Pulsar just keeps becoming more of what is wanted, less of what isn't
      wanted and you get the updates the very moment they pass tests and,
      when possible, peer review.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's usable right now, it'll never (ever) be done and don't expect a
      Beta label. Those are outdated.
    </p>

  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h2>Who Uses Pulsar?</h2>
    <p>
      Families who want to own their data and the network that privately
      carries it. Small, medium and large businesses that want a manageable
      web site management system. Intercontinental enterprises that want
      usable technology that integrates well into their existing front end.
      Many will use the free online service and not host anything. Some will
      subscribe to the online service for enhanced features and a more
      professional/custom online appearance. They'll all succeed at
      publishing content online in a way that works for them.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h2>Why Use Pulsar?</h2>
    <p>
      You failed to explain the value of Facebook owning your data, and
      would rather personally own that data. You also don't want or need to
      build the whole system yourself. We do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, there is a desire to prove that MongoDB and Node.js are, "Ready
      for production." This buzzphrase is standing between people and their
      continued good health. So, Pulsar partly exists to shove this
      philosophical discussion out of the way of progress.

    <h1>Project Goals</h1>
    <p>
      The idea to create Pulsar happened Sunday, Feb 9, 2014, after I'd finally
      had enough of arguing for the use of Node.js and MongoDB using only words.
      I am sick of trying to convince people that these tools are all of
      enterprise grade and production ready. So, here it all is. I'm doing
      enterprise development on the MEAN stack, and it's running in the cloud
      on production servers separately from my development network at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulsar was created with the following primary goals:
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Be Deployable</dt>
      <dd>
        Pulsar will be easy to deploy and maintain by IT professionals and
        non-IT professionals alike.
      </dd>
      <dt>Be Easy</dt>
      <dd>Pulsar will be easy to use as a content creator</dd>
      <dd>Pulsar will be easy to use as a consumer</dd>
      <dt>Be Prolific</dt>
      <dd>
        Pulsar must provide the most advanced content publishing capabilities
        to the largest number of people. Constellation must connect people who
        want to share with one another.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      The end goal is to enable people to share content online while owning the
      content they share. A Pulsar instance will be no more public than its
      owner configures it to be. No Pulsar is mandated to participate in
      Constellation and can always exist as its own island powering its own
      private and highly secure community.

    <h1>Coming Soon: Constellation</h1>
    <p>
      Once Pulsar is more complete, Constellation will be launched. The
      Constellation service wants to become the planet's first
      decentralized social network. It is intended to be used by anyone
      who wants to own their data <em>and</em> the conversation around it
      instead of relying on monolithic companies like Facebook, Twitter
      or anyone <em>but</em> themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the planet's first truly distributed, decentralized social network enabling
      people to communicate in fun new ways while owning their data, Pulsar and
      Constellation may or may not change all of our lives, but it might touch a
      few. And, that's the hope. That's all there is to it. Touch a few lives and
      help them make positive changes.
