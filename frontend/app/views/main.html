  Welcome to Pulsar!
  <small>
    Other CMS vendors are now on notice that your reign of terror over
    content creators, application developers and data center managers is
    now officially coming to a rapid close. Thank you for your service.
    You moved the whole Internet. But, your services are no longer
    required.

    This...is Pulsar. It is a brand-new content management system being built
    on the <a href="http://mean.io">MEAN stack</a>. It is already more
    technologically advanced than anything you're using and I am seriously
    just getting started.

    Like...yes...that is a responsive YouTube video with a drop shadow.
    Because? Screw your judgementalism, okay? It's because, well, I just want to
    be left alone here with my post-apocalyptic zombie dubstep violin music to
    create the most advanced CMS engine you've ever seen <em>and</em> an online
    service to go with it. It's entirely about you and your experience no matter
    who "you" are. So, "you" can just sit there and wait while I write the
    JavaScript backing required to make that shadow pulse with the bass in the
    music, mmmkay, pumkin?

    I type fast, but damn... Gimme a minute. I'm trying to break the Internet,
    and I'm really picky about my soundtrack while I'm doing it...
