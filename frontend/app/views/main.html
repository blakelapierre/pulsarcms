    <h1>Welcome to Pulsar!</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Pulsar is a new content management system being built with one very
      important primary concern: High-quality user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulsar is built on the <a href="http://mean.io">MEAN stack</a>, and my
      intention is to keep it simple. I am just getting started.

  <h1>Sample Blog</h1>
  <p>
    This is a sample of a blog built with Pulsar. The data model and API already
    support likes and dislikes. I'm working on the UI for those. Comments are
    implemented. Open any post and scroll down. No need to create an account or
    login to comment on a post. I have other ways of preventing spam. Just enjoy
    the blog and feel free to leave some feedback. This is intended to be a
    discsussion and not just a demonstration of what Pulsar can do.
