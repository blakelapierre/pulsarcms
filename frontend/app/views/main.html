  <h1>What Is This?</h1>
  <p>
    Pulsar is <a href="/#/about">Rob Colbert</a>'s personal CMS project. Have a
    look around and learn more about what this software can do.

  <div class="cta-button-container text-center">
    <a href="/#/signup"
       class="btn btn-default btn-lg cta-button"
       >
      Create Profile
    </a>

<p>
  The fastest and most helpful way to help is to create an account/profile and
  post content here. I don't care what it is within reason. As you do, feel free
  to share any feedback you might have. Another way to get involved is to install
  Pulsar and run your own instance. A valid use of Pulsar would be as a family's
  personal server to share photos with friends and family without the advertising
  and privacy violations and incessant game invites of Facebook.

<h2><img src="favicon.ico"> How It Works</h2>
<p>
  Pulsar is similar to blogging software. But, instead of posts, Pulsar
  creates pulses. Pulses range from static documents similar to standard
  blog posts created in Pulsar Composer to highly interactive, dynamic
  video games and other applications created in Pulsar Studio. Watch
  <a href="/#/moving-parts">Moving Parts</a>, a work-in-progress example
  of what Pulsar Studio can already do. Next, have a look at
  <a href="/#/prototype">Prototype</a>, a finished example of what Pulsar
  Studio can do.
</p>

<p>
  From personal blogs to news sites to music sites to online games to
  web applications of all types, Pulsar wants to be a technology you can use to
  quickly meet your content creation and website management goals. It is easy to
  deploy, very easy to maintain, handles remarkable levels of traffic with no
  single points of failure end-to-end and sits atop some of the best modern
  technology that money <em>can't</em> buy.
