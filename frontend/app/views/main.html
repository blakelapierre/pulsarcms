      Pulsar is a new way to publish and share online. Pulsar is also an experiment
      trying to prove a few facts here &amp; there about some of the technology it uses.
      But, that probably won't matter much to you.

      <a href="/#/prototype">Watch this</a>. Then, have a look
      <a href="/#/prototype/source">at this</a>. When viewed by the right
      people, those two links say everything that's needed for now to
      answer how Pulsar is (I prefer to say) different from other blog
      and content management systems. It is so open and modular that you
      can build your own application against the Pulsar API server, and
      have every single feature of this application integrated into
      whatever you're building.
    </p>
    <p>
      From personal blogs to news sites to music sites to online games to
      enterprise applications of all types, Pulsar wants to be a technology
      you can use to quickly meet your content and website management goals.
      It is easy to deploy, easy to maintain, handles remarkable levels of
      traffic and scale and sits atop some of the best modern technology.

    <h2><img src="favicon.ico" /> Is This a Beta?</h2>
    <p>
      Nope. Pulsar is an Agile software product with continuous integration
      to production. That pretty much means that, from this moment forward,
      Pulsar just keeps becoming more of what is wanted, less of what isn't
      wanted and you get the updates the very moment they pass tests and,
      when possible, peer review.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's usable right now, it'll never (ever) be done and don't expect a
      Beta label. Those are outdated.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h2><img src="favicon.ico" /> Who Uses Pulsar?</h2>
    <p>
      Families who want to own their data and the network that privately
      carries it. Small, medium and large businesses that want a manageable
      web site management system. Intercontinental enterprises that want
      usable technology that integrates well into their existing front end.
      Many will use the free online service and not host anything. Some will
      subscribe to the online service for enhanced features and a more
      professional/custom online appearance. They'll all succeed at
      publishing content online in a way that works for them.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h2><img src="favicon.ico" /> Why Use Pulsar?</h2>
    <p>
      You failed to explain the value of Facebook owning your data, and
      would rather personally own that data. You also don't want or need to
      build the whole system yourself. We do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, there is a desire to prove that MongoDB and Node.js are, "Ready
      for production." This buzzphrase is standing between people and their
      continued good health. So, Pulsar partly exists to shove this
      philosophical discussion out of the way of progress.

    <h1><img src="favicon.ico" /> Project Goals</h1>
    <p>
      The idea to create Pulsar happened Sunday, Feb 9, 2014, after I'd finally
      had enough of arguing for the use of Node.js and MongoDB using only words.
      I am sick of trying to convince people that these tools are all of
      enterprise grade and production ready. So, here it all is. I'm doing
      enterprise development on the MEAN stack, and it's running in the cloud
      on production servers separately from my development network at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulsar was created with the following primary goals:
    </p>

    <dl class="dl-horizontal">

      <dt>Be Easy</dt>
      <dd>for content creators</dd>
      <dd>for consumers/users</dd>
      <dd>for IT professionals and non-IT professionals</dd>

      <dt>Be Prolific</dt>
      <dd>
        Pulsar must provide the most advanced content publishing capabilities
        to the largest number of people. Constellation must connect people who
        want to share with one another.
      </dd>

      <dt>Be Enterprise-Grade</dt>
      <dd>Acknowledge that, initially, commodity hosting is a challenge</dd>
      <dd>Solve commodity hosting shortages with public service for all</dd>
      <dd>Offer a repeatable deployment toolset for self-hosted users</dd>
      <dd>Support integration with custom deployment toolchains for enterprise users</dd>
      <dd>Have a documented, repeatable development environment</dd>

    </dl>
    <p>
      The end goal is to enable people to share content online while owning the
      content they share. A Pulsar instance will be no more public than its
      owner configures it to be. No Pulsar is mandated to participate in
      Constellation and can always exist as its own island powering its own
      private and highly secure community.
    </p>

    <h3><img src="favicon.ico" /> Adoption Goals</h3>
    <p>
      Pulsar is currently in an early-adopter phase of rapid-fire development. It
      is not advised to deploy Pulsar for production service at this time. The
      target audience looks like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Technophiles and "gadget geeks" who want to experiment with all emerging
        technology.
      </li>
      <li>
        Software developers who want to create custom Pulsar clients, mobile apps
        and other solutions using the Pulsar content platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        API developers who want to easily and quickly create custom Node.js
        powered applications. MongoDB is not a requirement for anything built
        in addition to Pulsar's core services. MongoDB is absolutely required
        for Pulsar's core. This reqirement will change if and only if MongoDB
        no longer exists.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enterprise software developers looking for a case study being conducted
        in public to determine whether enterprise-grade software development is
        possible on the MEAN stack and whether the MEAN stack is, "Production
        ready."
      <li>
        Content creators curious about getting to experiment with a whole new
        publishing paradigm. <a href="/#/prototype">View the current prototype</a>
        to see an example of what Pulsar can do :)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Pulsar's next target audience will be progressive advertising agencies with
      advanced messages to deliver, educational institutions with important
      communcations to enable and security experts to tear it to shreds and make
      sure it stays on track with industry best practices and standards (or ahead
      of them, if posible).

    <h1><img src="favicon.ico" /> Coming Soon: Constellation</h1>
    <p>
      Once Pulsar is more complete, Constellation will be launched. The
      Constellation service wants to become the planet's first
      decentralized social network. It is intended to be used by anyone
      who wants to own their data <em>and</em> the conversation around it
      instead of relying on monolithic companies like Facebook, Twitter
      or anyone <em>but</em> themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the planet's first truly distributed, decentralized social network enabling
      people to communicate in fun new ways while owning their data, Pulsar and
      Constellation may or may not change all of our lives, but it might touch a
      few. And, that's the hope. That's all there is to it. Touch a few lives and
      help them make positive changes.
