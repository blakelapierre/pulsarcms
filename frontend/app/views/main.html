        Lindsey Stirling does not endorse Pulsar. And, this paragraph is only
        here to demonstrate that your content layout options are limitless on
        Pulsar. If you know HTML and CSS, I truly do mean limitless. And, if
        not, Pulsar integrates with and provides a lot of today's best content
        layout and text editing tools.

        Make no mistake: I am not a front-end UX designer. I am a hard-core
        programmer who is looking for one. So, I'm doing my best to show you
        what Pulsar can do. Trust: In the right hands, it does everything.

  <h1>Welcome to Pulsar!</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Pulsar is a brand-new content management system being built with one very
    important primary concern: High-Quality user experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pulsar is built on the <a href="http://mean.io">MEAN stack</a>, and my
    intention is to keep it simple. I am just getting started.

    And, yes: Thanks to technology such as
    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>
    and a little personal CSS-fu, that actually <em>is</em> a responsive
    embedded YouTube video with a drop shadow and gorgeous text powered by
    <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>
    flowing freely around it.

    Please resize the browser window. Take it down to mobile phone sizes and all
    the way to full screen (press F11 in most browsers). From yesterday's phones
    to a performance venue's projection grid arrays, Pulsar ensures your content
    looks as good as it possibly can. It's an excellent tool for building touch
    screen kiosks, interactive sales displays and more.

<h1>Sample Blog</h1>
<p>
  This is a sample of a blog built with Pulsar. The data model and API already
  support likes and dislikes. I'm working on the UI for those. Comments are
  implemented. Open any post and scroll down. No need to create an account or
  login to comment on a post. I have other ways of preventing spam. Just enjoy
  the blog and feel free to leave some feedback. This is intended to be a
  discsussion and not just a demonstration of what Pulsar can do.
</p>

<div class="row post" ng-repeat="post in posts">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <h1><a href="#/posts/{{post._id}}" title="{{post.title}}">{{post.title}}</a></h1>
    <div ng-bind-html="post.excerpt"></div>
    <p>
      <a href="#/posts/{{post._id}}" title="{{post.title}}">Continue reading...</a>

<h2>Developing On Pulsar</h2>
<p>
  Pulsar doesn't get themed. No CMS should. Pulsar does not want to be a rigid
  monolith that lets you edit a little CSS and add an HTML file. That whole
  paradigm is entirely too limiting to your designs. Instead, developers are
  encouraged to build a custom client/front-end of their own design using
  AngularJS (obviously my preference) or <em>whatever else you want to use</em>
  if that's what you really want to do. Building on AngularJS means you can
  use the ng-pulsar framework and finish faster.
</p>
<p>
  Because Pulsar isn't a single server, it's
  two. The Pulsar API server is powered by Node.js atop MongoDB. Separately,
  the Pulsar front end isn't even technically a server. It's an HTML5
  single-page application client that works more like desktop software than a
  web page. And, you have complete freedom in its hosting if you even decide to
  use it.
</p>
<p>
  I am using Apache httpd. But, if "it" throws a file onto a wire when properly
  asked to do so, it'll work. Pulsar's front end really is just a bunch of
  static, cache-busted, concatenated, minified and crunched standard MIME-typed
  assets. I'm serving this very site from atop a mountain in Pennsylvania using
  ridiculously unstable DSL service with a 1Mbps upstream connection to you
  when it decides to stay connected. So, yes. It's "tested" (daily).
</p>

<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
  I am primarily building Pulsar at this time as a portfolio piece that will
  eventually ship to the market. It's actually a race. If I become employed
  and that does not involve working on Pulsar, it'll be a while. If I succeed
  in get at least a little funding to be able to pay rent and bills while
  finishing this and building a team for it, then Pulsar becomes available to
  the public sooner.
