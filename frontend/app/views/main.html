        Pulsar is a new way to publish and share your stuff online. It's just
        trying to solve <strike>simple</strike> interesting problems using
        interesting technology. It's also trying to prove a few sciencey points
        here &amp; there, and you either care about that or not. Won't matter.

    <h2>When?</h2>
    <p>
      Pulsar is an Agile software product with continuous integration to
      production. That pretty much means that, from this moment forward,
      Pulsar just keeps becoming more of what is wanted, less of what isn't
      wanted and you get the updates the very moment they pass tests and,
      when possible, peer review.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's usable right now, it'll never (ever) be done and don't expect a
      Beta label. Those are outdated.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h2>Who?</h2>
    <p>
      Families who want to own their data and the network that carries it.
      Small, medium and large businesses that want a manageable web site
      management system. Intercontinental enterprises that want something
      that integrates well into their existing front end. A lot of people
      will simply use the free online service and not host anything. But,
      they'll all succeed at publishing content online in a way that works
      for them.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      You failed to explain the value of Facebook owning your data, and
      would rather personally own that data. You also don't want or need to
      build the whole system yourself. We do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, there is a desire to prove that MongoDB and Node.js are, "Ready
      for production." This buzzphrase is standing between people and their
      continued good health. So, Pulsar partly exists to shove this
      philosophical discussion out of the way of progress.
    </p>

<h2>Near Future</h2>
<div style="margin-top:32px; background-image:url('images/constellation-bg.jpg');background-size:cover; color:white; padding:8px;">
  <h1 style="padding-top:0; margin-top:8px; margin-left:60px;">Constellation</h1>
  <div style="margin:16px; padding:16px; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9); color:black;">
    Once Pulsar is more complete, Constellation will be launched. The
    Constellation service wants to become the planet's first
    decentralized social network. It is intended to be used by anyone
    who wants to own their data <em>and</em> the conversation around it
    instead of relying on monolithic companies like Facebook, Twitter
    or anyone <em>but</em> themselves.
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Long-Term</h2>
<p>
  As the planet's first truly distributed, decentralized social network enabling
  people to communicate in fun new ways while owning their data, Pulsar and
  Constellation may or may not change all of our lives, but it might touch a
  few. And, that's the hope. That's all there is to it. Touch a few lives and
  help them make positive changes. Period. Anything else that happens along the
  way will be considered an unitended but necessary step along the path.
