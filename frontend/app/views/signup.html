<p ng-show="!isComplete">
  Thanks for taking Pulsar out for a test drive. Your feedback is highly
  anticipated and greatly appreciated. Over the coming weeks as more
  features are added, the hope is for people to simply have a lot of fun
  here proving that Node.js and MongoDB are, in fact, ready for production
  deployments. Because, well, here they are!

    And, the developers of Pulsar want you to know we're already aware of
    it. Because if you can see this, it also got reported to us by Pulsar
    itself. Thanks for helping us find it!

  An email has been sent to {{user.email}}. Please check both your inbox and spam
  folder for an email from Pulsar asking you to verify your email address. You can
  not post content here until you verify your email address.

<h2 ng-show="!isComplete">About Your Account</h2>
<p ng-show="!isComplete">
  Your email address is your Pulsar identity. While it isn't shown to anyone
  or used for anything else you don't choose, it is the ID you must provide
  along with your provided password to login and create content on Pulsar. An
  email will be sent to the address provided. You will not be permitted to
  create content on Pulsar until you've verified your email address.
</p>
<p ng-show="!isComplete">
  Your display name is the name others will read when they see you online,
  read your posts and comments and more. Basically, that's the name you want
  people to read so we don't have to call you yourname@someservice.com (even
  if that's not your email address, it's what we'd call you without a display
  name). It doesn't even need to be unique. You can all be Oompa Loompa. But,
  if you're name-spoofing, people will probably block you. It'll be interesting
  to see if there can, in fact, only be one Ooompa Loompa, or if more than one
  will be a real problem.

<p ng-show="!isComplete">
  Please, though...take a moment and choose a password to keep your blog and
  content safe. Treat it like a car buying experience. And, if you need a
  little emotional support or perhaps spiritual guidance during the password
  creation process, it's always best to keep trying until "Very Strong" is
  displayed where "Very Weak" used to be as you started trying. You won't be
  allowed to submit the form until the passwords at least match.
