    <h4>We collect personal and activity data, which may be linked.</h4>
    <p>We use technologies like cookies (small files stored on your browser), web beacons, or unique device identifiers to identify your computer or device so we can deliver a better experience. Our systems also log information like your browser, operating system and IP address.</p>

    <p>We collect personally identifiable information that you provide to us, such as your display name (unverified) and email address.</p>

    <p>Our systems may associate this personal information with your activities in the course of providing service to you by design (such as pages you view or things you click on or search for).</p>

    <p>We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.</p>

    <p>Our service does not currently recognize the "Do Not Track" signal that may be available in some web browsers.</p>

    <h4>We collect or share your location only with permission.</h4>
    <p>In serving you, we may use or store your precise geographic location, if you give us permission to do so. We do not use or share this data for any other purpose. Many devices will indicate through an icon when location services are operating. We only share this location information with others as approved by you.</p>

    <h4>You can request to see or delete your personal data.</h4>
    <p>You can sign into your account to see or delete any personally identifiable information we have stored, such as your name and email address. You can also contact us by email to request to see or delete this information.</p>

    <h4>We keep personal data until you delete it.</h4>
    <p>We remove personally identifiable information (such as your name and email address) and other preferences associated with your account promptly after you delete your account. We may retain other data (comments you've made and conversations you've participated in) indefinitely.</p>

    <h4>We don't share your personal data with other companies.</h4>
    <p>We generally do not share personally identifiable information (such as name, address, email or phone) with other companies. Your email address is not displayed to others by Pulsar, your display name is called a display name because it's on display and you should know that and we don't collect or want to know anything else.</p>

    <p>If, however, you put this information into a pulse/post/page/comment/<wbr>message, then do realize you've made the information public and it may persist for much longer than you had hoped when creating it (perhaps while drunk).</p>

    <h4>No ad companies collect data through our service.</h4>
    <p>We do not allow advertising companies to collect data through our service for ad targeting. And, that's because PULSAR-ONE does not display any advertising whatsoever from any source anywhere at all (and won't).</p>

    <h4>You can ask privacy questions or opt-out of marketing.</h4>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies, please contact me at <a href="mailto:rob.isConnected@gmail.com" target="_blank">rob.isConnected@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <p>If you have provided contact information but do not want to be contacted with promotional or marketing information, you can opt-out in the Account Settings page located at: <a href="http://robcolbert.com/#/settings">http://robcolbert.com/#/settings</a></p>

    <p>All requests are processed immediately by an automated system.</p>

    <h4>Analytics providers access data on our behalf.</h4>
    <p>Analytics companies may access anonymous data (such as your IP address or device ID) to help us understand how our services are used. They use this data solely on our behalf. They do not share it except in aggregate form; no data is shared as to any individual user. Click to see company privacy policies that govern their use of data.</p>

    <h5><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank" title="Learn more about Google's privacy policy">Google Analytics</a></h5>
    <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how visitors engage with their website. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so they can improve it. Google Analytics collects information anonymously. It reports website trends without identifying individual visitors.</p>

    <h4>We take detailed steps to protect personal information.</h4>
    <p>We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes storing your information in encrypted form behind a firewall designed to block access from outside our network. However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.</p>

    <p>Information we collect will be stored and processed on computers located in the United States of America.</p>

    <h4>Special situations may require disclosure of your data.</h4>
    <p>To operate the service, we also may make identifiable and anonymous information available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (1) with your express consent, (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, (3) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to protect our rights or property, or (4) to any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets. Your consent will not be required for disclosure in these cases, but we will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.</p>

    <h4>You can review more privacy-related information.</h4>

If we make any material changes to our policies, we will place a prominent notice on our website or application.
