        A computer programmer (Rob) snapped the fuck out one day. After two straight
        decades in computer software, Rob quit the last perm/full-time programming job
        he'll ever work. Because, after more than a <strong>decade</strong> of fighting
        with various IT assholes over this &amp; that at various companies, Rob finally
        asked, "Why is this always a fight? Am <em>I</em> perhaps the one who is
        flawed in my pursuit of progress?" And, with that in mind, Rob set off on a
        journey to find out. Pulsar <em>is</em> that journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because, as far as Rob could see from his desk in application developer land, it
        was no longer worth trying to succeed. Here he is bending over backwards to keep
        himself current for all these years while raising a family, <em>burying</em> a
        son, always working overtime... and... for what? A never-ending fight with a bunch
        of <strong>assholes</strong>? Yes, I fucking <strong>hate</strong> you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, until he figures out what he's going to actually be doing next and where that
        might be located, he's not interested in whatever you're saying because he's too
        fucking busy right here making all this progress while trying to independently pay
        the rent and bills. Because fuck an investor, etc., I intend to <em>own</em> this.

      Ship Pulsar Studio.

    <h2><img src="favicon.ico" /> Adoption Goals</h2>
    <p>
      None. Use it if you want to. It's subject to change, quite early and might break if
      you use it in a way I couldn't predict.
