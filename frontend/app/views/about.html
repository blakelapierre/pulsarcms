  I'm a freedom-loving individual living and working in Pittsburgh, PA, as a
  web developer. I build software that saves companies money and reduces our
  dependence on foreign oil among other beneficial side effects. I've been a
  professional software developer since 1994, and have been writing software
  since I was a child.

  I was admitted into the Gifted and Talented Education (G.A.T.E.) program in
  4th grade. I attended Carnegie Mellon University's Advanced Placement/Early
  Admission program as one of two students from the state of Pennsylvania in
  1990 between my junior and senior years of high school. I'm that guy the IT
  director at CCAC invited to come to North Carolina to interview at American
  Express, but went and made video games for almost 20 years like an idiot.

  I'm that guy to who does whatever the fuck he wants whenever he wants. I have
  no respect for clocks on the wall, I'll be there when I'll be there...but my
  code won't be late.

  I do not give a flying fuck, generally speaking. Be about facts. Or, get
  the fuck out of my face before I pick you up and put you in another room. I
  smoke weed...in an illegal state...because fuck the NSA, Obama and the
  <em>whole</em> federal government. I don't pay my federal taxes, and have no
  intention of paying them until they stop bombing children.
