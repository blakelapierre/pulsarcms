    <h2>Pulsar</h2>
    <p>
      The page you are on right now is powered by a content management system
      called Pulsar. Consider it to be a kind of "node" to which people can connect
      and do things. Pulsar isn't the page you're looking at. It's actually a JSON
      REST API powered by MongoDB and Node.js. This is just an HTML5 single-page
      application that connects to Pulsar and does stuff with it.

    <h2>Constellation</h2>
    <p>
      Constellation is a service. Instances of Pulsar may elect to register as
      part of a Constellation. When they do, users of any Pulsar in the
      Constellation may discover, communicate and share with potentially all
      user(s) in the Constallation.

  <h3>For Families</h3>
    <div style="max-height:320px; overflow:auto;">
      <p>
        A family, for example, can run a Pulsar instance on a server in their home.
        They can use it for photo sharing, a shared calendar, message board, recipes,
        video and multimedia center. It's also a private messaging center for the
        family.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Pulsar, you can upload a 1080p HD video from your phone and watch it
        on grandma's computer without visiting grandma. Maybe grandma lives in a
        different state and, truth be told, not every video belongs on YouTube for
        the world to see. Have grandma create an account on your Pulsar. Problem
        solved.

    <h3>For Schools</h3>
    <div style="max-height:320px; overflow:auto;">
      <p>
        A teacher at a high school can run a Pulsar on an old computer to connect
        with her students and connect the students with each other using mobile
        handsets, netbooks, laptops, desktops and tablets. Students can operate a
        blog, collaborate on homework, post status updates to the class and
        send/receive messages to teachers using one easy application that runs the
        same everywhere on all devices with excellent accessibility features.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's just the Web. Teachers and students understand social networks. Pulsar
        lets them build private, controlled environments that don't have the same
        distractions as public networks in the form of advertising and games.

      <p>
        Slow, outdated web sites don't get the conversions they could. Stop
        daydreaming about the possibilities for your site if only you had access to
        advanced tools. Pulsar gives you an advanced platform and tools to build
        whatever is needed within reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        A company might, for example, run a Pulsar detached from all Constellations
        with no public user accounts. Administrative staff create blog posts, post
        products to a product database and staff a live online customer support chat
        system using PulseWire (real-time messaging add-on for Pulsar).
      </p>
      <p>
        Very large video game companies with multiple studios/teams might run one
        Pulsar instance per team/studio and a Constellation to represent the whole
        company and all of its games in one place.

<h2>What Does It Take?</h2>
<p>
  Anyone with a persistent Internet connection and a computer supported by
  MongoDB and Node.js can run a Pulsar. While most people will use a Pulsar
  being operated by someone else, anyone is free to obtain and run a copy of
  Pulsar on any supported computer for any purpose whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
  Once installed, you simple give people your address. They connect, create an
  account and immediately have a profile on your Pulsar. They can do whatever
  you enable them to do.
</p>

<h2>Developing On Pulsar</h2>
<p>
  Pulsar doesn't get themed. No CMS should. Pulsar does not want to be a rigid
  monolith that lets you edit a little CSS and add an HTML file. That whole
  paradigm is entirely too limiting to your designs. Instead, developers are
  encouraged to build a custom client/front-end of their own design using
  AngularJS (obviously my preference) or <em>whatever else you want to use</em>
  if that's what you really want to do. Building on AngularJS means you can
  use the ng-pulsar framework and finish faster.
</p>
<p>
  Because Pulsar isn't a single server, it's
  two. The Pulsar API server is powered by Node.js atop MongoDB. Separately,
  the Pulsar front end isn't even technically a server. It's an HTML5
  single-page application client that works more like desktop software than a
  web page. And, you have complete freedom in its hosting if you even decide to
  use it.
</p>
<p>
  I am using Apache httpd. But, if "it" throws a file onto a wire when properly
  asked to do so, it'll work. Pulsar's front end really is just a bunch of
  static, cache-busted, concatenated, minified and crunched standard MIME-typed
  assets. I'm serving this very site from atop a mountain in Pennsylvania using
  ridiculously unstable DSL service with a 1Mbps upstream connection to you
  when it decides to stay connected. So, yes. It's "tested" (daily).
