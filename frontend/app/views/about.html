        You ever feel like you're sitting in a meeting being asked to do
        something in a way for which you know a simpler, more feasible way
        exists? Imagine, for example, being constantly forced (as a carpenter)
        to use a <em>jackhammer</em> when the task is roofing shingles. Can it
        be done? Sure. With enough effort. But, a simpler approach does exist.
        The carpenter may prefer to use a simple hammer. It's a job for which
        the jackhammer does not make things go faster or better. Nail gun?
        Yes. Jackhammer? Too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also talking about the kind of feeling that tends to set in after
        hearing requests to use WordPress, Liferay or perhaps Drupal to build a
        highly interactive non-blog site that works nothing like they do. It's
        the feeling that happens when being asked to use J2EE spanning all of
        Spring, Struts, Hibernate, portal containers and a spendy Oracle
        database to build the simplest of CRUD apps like an in-house PTO request
        form that sees 12 "hits" per month.
      </p>
      <p>
        I get that sinking feeling all the time. In fact, in a former life, I
        got this feeling almost daily. And, yes...beyond a point...I decided
        I'd simply had enough.

        I am a veteran computer programmer with over 20 years of experience in
        video games, low-level networking, systems and embedded software
        development. I've designed, written, implemented, tested, deployed
        and/or maintained systems in the domains of single-player and online
        games, backbone-grade network equipment, enterprise applications,
        educational software and training simulations. I've hand-built 2D and 3D
        graphics and presentation systems, audio processing and streaming
        libraries, entire online gaming systems and the tools/asset pipelines to
        support them all.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've done these things in contributing, lead and architect roles since
        about 1994. I have been constantly learning to program computers since
        about 1987. And, I've <em>always</em> loved what I've gotten to do:
        Create. It's why I write code. The past ten years of my career, however,
        has been spent fighting non-stop with various "IT Professionals" over
        this &amp; that at various companies in my <strike>past</strike> wake.
        And, I eventually realized that I'm simply <em>too</em> advanced for the
        average IT Professional's comfort level.

              Would you believe I've been asked to create seven red perpendicular
              lines using green and transparent ink in the form of a kitten more
              than once in my career? The kitten baloon only happened once,
              though.

        So, I've deicded to stop trying to succeed along that whole path. They
        can keep it. Instead, I've changed the <em>questions</em> I am asking.
        I've stopped asking, "How do I show them a better way?" or, "How do I
        stay sane here?" I finally realized that I don't have to care. So, I've
        simply stopped asking those goofy questions. And, today? I guess I'm
        only interested in knowing:
        <blockquote>
          Why is this always a fight? Am I perhaps the one who is flawed in my
          pursuit of innovation?
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
        With this new mantra in mind, I set off on a journey to find the answer.
        Pulsar <em>is</em> that journey. And, it's a personal journey in open
        source community membership, modern technology stacks and patience.
        Because today, the page you're reading is being served by Pulsar, an
        application of my own creation sitting atop the MEAN stack. And, it's
        running in production without issues. Ever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pieces of the MEAN stack such as MongoDB may not be the perfect tool for
        <em>every</em> job. True statement. But, I argue it is perfectly
        acceptable for use when I say it is. And, I argue that on the basis that
        the 20 years of experience known as, "Rob Colbert," has been doing the
        sort of shit you go home and dream and/or have
        <span class="quake">nightmares</span> about for all twenty of these
        years.

        I'm simply sick of having some "IT Professional" constantly trying to
        tell me how to do my job just because the words coming out of my mouth
        aren't: Oracle, MySQL and/or Java.
