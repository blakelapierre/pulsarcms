    <h1>About Rob</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a freedom-loving individual living and working as a web developer in
      Pittsburgh, PA. I've been a professional software developer since 1994, and
      I've been writing advanced, inventive software since I was a child. This has
      been a long road for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a very inventive person. I have the ability to create extremely complex
      things quickly and from scratch. And, that's what I enjoy doing. From a
      prototype to bootstrapping a new development effort to answering a question in
      software for the very first time, it's simply what I enjoy doing. I genuinely
      enjoy making computers do everything.
    </p>

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>
      In 4th grade, I began formally studying the BASIC programming language in my
      school's Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program. By 7th grade, I had a
      video game entered into a state-wide competition. Between my junior and senior
      years of high school, I was selected as one of two students to attend Carnegie
      Mellon's Advanced Placement/Early Admission program where I studied the Pascal
      programming language in a University setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've formally studied BASIC, Pascal, C, Assembly and COBOL (in that exact order).
      I've taught myself C++, Java, JavaScript, Lua, TCL, CSS and HTML. I have written
      full TCP/IP stacks that run in user space with their own ARP modules, etc., to
      simulate millions of "virtual" PCs using only 96 rack-mounted hosts. And, I've
      written systems that punch through consumer-grade NAT hardware to connect game
      players in peer-to-peer grids on PCs and video game consoles.

      I used to run the OnDemand! BBS as part of the networks that predate the
      Internet and ran entirely on dial-up modems. I've built BBS "door" games in C on
      DOS. I've built systems that test very high capacity Cisco switches and routers.
      I've built the systems that power some of your favorite online games. And, I've
      built systems that simulate a full range of medical conditions experienced by a
      soldier at war in Iraq at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi. I've written
      a smoothed particle hydrodynamics system to simulate human blood in real time as
      a nurse stresses over which decisions are the right decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to understand: I've built systems that have made battle-hardened nurses who
      have served in actaul war...faint. I am very specifically talking about my code
      running on an insanely fast Alienware laptop on a series of projectors at an
      actual military base in south Texas. At that presentation, an actual military
      nurse...fainted. And, that's because when you ask me to, "Keep it real," you
      seriously have no idea what kind of twisted shit is headed your way. Please,
      think carefully before asking. Because they said, "It absolutely has to be as
      close to real life as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      I built a shader that simulates the oxidation of blood over time taking it from
      a smooth, shiny liquid through to full clot (hard, crusty, cracks). The particle
      system considered coagulation and ambient environment temperatures as variables.
      The simulation was implemented against Ageia Phys-X with a continuous time domain
      and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation that responded to the rigid
      bodies in the scene. I was, therefore, able to also have those algorithms consider
      the effects of surface friction <em>and</em> the properties of the blood to make
      the blood "stick" to surfaces and "slide" and "slosh" around as if it existed in
      reality. The simulation was precise and tested correct. It would stain clothing
      differently than painted surfaces differently than sand, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made a military nurse faint. I'm done talking.

      Because one of my more likeable side projects that's been on hold while focusing
      on Pulsar is
      <a href="http://generator.voltagetechnician.com/" target="_blank">GENERATOR</a>,
      an actual software synthesizer built in JavaScript using the WebAudio API with
      an HTML5 single-page application front-end.

      And, this guy does a great job of explaining how the WebAudio API works. So, if
      you're interested in how GENERATOR achieves what it does, this guy:

      I wrote the system that served the web page you're reading right now. This isn't
      WordPress. This is Pulsar. It is my custom content management system. And, I
      built it because I'm tired of trying to extract the results I want from
      off-the-shelf CMS suites. I built Pulsar so it would just work, dammit. And, yes,
      Pulsar is a complete content engine and backing store. Tools like GENERATOR will
      use it for their persistence layer once integrated (soon).

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
      I've been creating music for as long as I've been disassembling my toys to
      make new ones and creating software. Much like software, the process of creating
      something amazing out of nothing is what music is all about for me. I love
      listening to other people's music as much as creating my own.

      When in high school, one of my part time jobs was working at The Flagrant
      Underground recording studio on Pittsburgh's North Side. There, I learned all
      the ins &amp; outs of working with professional audio equipment, and quickly
      became one of Pittsburgh's first MIDI recording engineers. To this day, I mostly
      work entirely in digital unless I'm not.

      About a year ago, I got the opportunity to work with Paul West, a guitarist I
      used to play in a band with back in high school. We created a couple of tracks in
      Ableton Live. Here's how one turned out:

    <h2>Cannabis</h2>

      I personally do all I can to support and also practice the cultivation of medical
      cannabis and the delivery of this medicine to patients.
