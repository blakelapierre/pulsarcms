            I am a veteran software developer with over 20 years in games,
            extremely low-level networking, systems and embedded programming.
            I've written TCP/IP stacks from scratch in C++ that ran in user
            space on RHEL5 directly talking to the NIC with its own ARP module
            and more, memory heap managers for PlayStation&reg;, and 2D/3D
            graphics, presentation frameworks and audio processing for anything
            with a CPU and audio chip from the phone in your pocket to very
            advanced training simulations built for the Office of Naval Research
            that runs on actual Naval submarines.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a full-stack Web developer who's done things like hack the
            TIME_WAIT state out of spent sockets in a custom Linux-based
            distributed test harness and framework and generally done whatever
            it takes to make things work and get work done. And, when doing that,
            I prefer to use the right tools for the job.
          </p>
          <p>
            True, MEAN may not be the perfect tool for every job. But, I argue it
            is perfectly acceptable for use when I say it is and when I'm the
            one building the requested solution instead of you. You...get to learn
            and host it when it's done. And, if you're saying anything other than
            asking me how, I'm going to let you figure it out on your own...or
            quit. I do not care which.

    After more than a decade of fighting with various "IT Professionals" over
    this &amp; that, I decided to stop trying to succeed along that path and
    changed the <em>questions</em> I was asking.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've stopped asking, "How do I show them this is the best way?" Today, I'm
    only asking this:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Why is this always a fight? Am I perhaps the one who
      is flawed in my constant pursuit of progress and innovation?
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    With this new mantra in mind, I set off on a journey to find the answer.
    Pulsar <em>is</em> that journey. And, it's a personal journey in open
    source community membership, modern technology stacks and personal
    patience. Because today, the page you're reading is being served by
    Pulsar, an application of my own creation sitting atop the MEAN stack.
  </p>
  <p>
    And, it's running in production without issues. Ever. So, to all the
    ridiculousness that was, "That'll never work/never happen!" I simply
    offer: "Here it is. How's <u>yesterday</u> treatin' ya?"
  </p>

  <h2><img src="favicon.ico" /> Adoption Goals</h2>
  <p>
    I don't have specific number. Use it if you want to. It's subject to
    change, quite early in development and might break if you use it in a way
    I didn't predict or said wouldn't work :)
