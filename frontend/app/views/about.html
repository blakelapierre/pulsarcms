    <h2>About Rob</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a freedom-loving individual living and working in Pittsburgh, PA, as a
      web developer. I build software that saves companies money and reduces our
      on things like foreign oil as well as some other beneficial side effects.
      I've been a professional software developer since 1994, and I've been
      writing software since I was a child.

    <p>
      I was admitted into the Gifted and Talented Education (G.A.T.E.) program in
      4th grade. I attended Carnegie Mellon University's Advanced Placement/Early
      Admission program as one of two students from the state of Pennsylvania in
      1990 between my junior and senior years of high school. I also didn't
      graduate with my class, had to go to summer school and get my diploma that
      way. I have an Associates Degree in Computer Science from the Community
      College of Allegheny County.

      I also wholeheartedly support and practice the cultivation of
      medical-grade cannabis.

    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
      I built this site from scratch using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS,
      AngularJS and Node.js). The front-end application is being served to the
      browser by Apache httpd on Ubuntu 12.04. The back-end API is powered by
      Node.js also running on Ubuntu 12.04.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is my personal blog, thought engine (because Twitter sucks) and
      technological playground. As I want to explore new technologies and learn
      them inside and out, I work on them here to build a new version of my
      personal site.
