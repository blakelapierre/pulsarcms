        A computer programmer (Rob) snapped the fuck out one day. After two straight
        decades in computer software, Rob quit the last programming job he'll ever
        work on purpose. Because, after more than a <strong>decade</strong> of fighting
        with various IT assholes over this &amp; that at various companies, Rob finally
        asked, "Why is this always a fight? Am <em>I</em> perhaps the one who is
        retarded?" And, with that in mind, Rob set off on a journey to find out. Pulsar
        <em>is</em> that journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because, as far as Rob could see from his desk in application developer land, it
        was no longer worth trying to succeed. Here he is bending over backwards to keep
        himself current for all these years while raising a family, <em>burying</em> a
        son, always working overtime... and... for what? A never-ending fight with a bunch
        of retarded <strong>assholes</strong>? Yes, Rob fucking <strong>hates</strong>
        you. ALL of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, he gave up the whole concept of working in corporate environments with other
        people for money. He also never wants to need to work with other human beings again
        (in software). (Ever). He simply can't <em>trust</em> that process anymore to
        ensure his and his family's needs are met. It does not work. He can not and will
        not succeed in your fucked-up, idiotic, nepotistic, corrupt, backward and apathetic
        world. He likes to <em>feel</em> something for what he does. So, he left that
        stagnant, stress-filled existence behind in a place where he really does not want
        to be anymore (Pittsburgh, PA).
      </p>
      <p>
        And, until he figures out what he's going to actually be doing next and where that
        might be located, he has eschewed all manner of personal responsibility down to not
        even making his <strong>wife's</strong> car payments while not giving a single fuck.
        Nothing along that path worked. Not one single thing. At all. Rob doesn't care if
        he ends up divorced, homeless, penniless and dead. He does not and will not write
        software for money in corporate environments anymore. And, as a direct result, he
        outright <em>owns</em> anything he builds, now.
