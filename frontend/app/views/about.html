    <h2>About Rob</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a freedom-loving individual living and working in Pittsburgh, PA, as a
      web developer. I build software that saves companies money and reduces our
      on things like foreign oil as well as some other beneficial side effects.
      I've been a professional software developer since 1994, and I've been
      writing software since I was a child.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was admitted into the Gifted and Talented Education (G.A.T.E.) program in
      4th grade. I attended Carnegie Mellon University's Advanced Placement/Early
      Admission program as one of two students from the state of Pennsylvania in
      1990 between my junior and senior years of high school. I also didn't
      graduate with my class, had to go to summer school and get my diploma that
      way. I have an Associates Degree in Computer Science from the Community
      College of Allegheny County.

      I also grow and consume medical-grade cannabis in the State of Pennsylvania
      as an act of civil disobedience of an unjust law. These bullshit
      prohibitionist laws can go straight to hell with the people who wrote and
      enforce them. There is no victim in what I'm doing. So, fuck you <em>and</em>
      your attitude about it. You want to waste your tax dollars giving me free
      room &amp; board? Bring it. I give no shits.

    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
      Rob Colbert built this site from scratch using the MEAN stack (MongoDB,
      ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js). The front-end application is being served
      to the browser by Apache httpd on Ubuntu 12.04. The back-end API is powered
      by Node.js also running on Ubuntu 12.04.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is my personal blog, thought engine (because Twitter sucks) and
      technological playground. As I want to explore new technologies and learn
      them inside and out, I work on them here to build a new version of my
      personal site.
    </p>
    <p>
      This accomplishes a couple of goals for me:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        My site always has fresh content to keep me relevant in search engine
        result pages; and
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm always working on something you <em>wish</em> you were reglardless
        <em>what</em> kind of "Request Denied" bullshit is coming out of the IT
        department of whatever company I'm working for at the moment. I don't your
        fucking permission to do whatever I want here, bitch!
