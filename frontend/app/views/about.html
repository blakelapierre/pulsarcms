      I'm a freedom-loving individual living and working in Pittsburgh, PA, as a
      web developer. I build software that saves companies money and reduces our
      on things like foreign oil as well as some other beneficial side effects.
      I've been a professional software developer since 1994, and I've been
      writing software since I was a child.

      I was admitted into the Gifted and Talented Education (G.A.T.E.) program in
      4th grade. I attended Carnegie Mellon University's Advanced Placement/Early
      Admission program as one of two students from the state of Pennsylvania in
      1990 between my junior and senior years of high school. I also didn't
      graduate with my class, had to go to summer school and get my diploma that
      way. I have an Associates Degree in Computer Science from the Community
      College of Allegheny County.

      I also grow and consume cannabis in the State of Pennsylvania...where it is
      <em>not</em> legal to do so...as an act of civil disobedience of an unjust
      law. Because these bullshit prohibitionist laws can go straight to hell with
      the people who wrote and enforce them. There is no victim in what I'm doing.
      Fuck you <em>and</em> your attitude about it. You mean literally nothing to me,
      my thoughts or my happiness. The concept of jail doesn't even alter my state
      of mind. You want to waste your tax dollars giving me free room &amp; board?
      Bring it. I give no shits.
