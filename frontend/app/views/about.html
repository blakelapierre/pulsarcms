    <h2>Pulsar</h2>
    <p>
      The page you are on right now is powered by a content management system
      called Pulsar. Consider it to be a kind of "node" to which people can connect
      and do things. Pulsar isn't the page you're looking at. It's actually a JSON
      REST API powered by MongoDB and Node.js. This is just an HTML5 single-page
      application that connects to Pulsar and does stuff with it.
    </p>

    <h2>Constellation</h2>
    <p>
      Constellation is a service in very early development. Instances of Pulsar
      may soon elect to register as part of a Constellation. When they do, users
      of any Pulsar in the Constellation may discover, communicate and share with
      potentially all user(s) in the Constallation.
    </p>

<h2>What Does It Take?</h2>
<p>
  Anyone with a persistent Internet connection and a computer supported by
  MongoDB and Node.js can run a Pulsar. While most people will use a Pulsar
  being operated by someone else, anyone is free to obtain and run a copy of
  Pulsar on any supported computer for any purpose whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
  Once installed, you simple give people your address. They connect, create an
  account and immediately have a profile on your Pulsar. They can do whatever
  you enable them to do.
</p>

<h2>Developing On Pulsar</h2>
<p>
  Pulsar doesn't get themed. No CMS should. Pulsar does not want to be a rigid
  monolith that lets you edit a little CSS and add an HTML file. That whole
  paradigm is entirely too limiting to your designs. Instead, developers are
  encouraged to build a custom client/front-end of their own design using
  AngularJS (obviously my preference) or <em>whatever else you want to use</em>
  if that's what you really want to do. Building on AngularJS means you can
  use the ng-pulsar framework and finish faster.
</p>
<p>
  Because Pulsar isn't a single server, it's
  two. The Pulsar API server is powered by Node.js atop MongoDB. Separately,
  the Pulsar front end isn't even technically a server. It's an HTML5
  single-page application client that works more like desktop software than a
  web page. And, you have complete freedom in its hosting if you even decide to
  use it.
</p>
<p>
  I am using Apache httpd in dev and thttpd in prod. But, if whatever you like
  throws a file onto a wire (quickly, please) when properly asked to do so,
  it'll work. The front end has no state (at all) from the perspective of its
  server. Pulsar's front end really is just a bunch of static, cache-busted,
  concatenated, minified and crunched standard MIME-typed assets.
</p>
<p>
  The public Pulsar instance running at robcolbert.com is hosted on donated
  hosting in the cloud on the tiniest of VMs they offer. It hasn't gone down
  once unless I've taken it down for an update. Everything stacked on one
  anemic box, no issues at all.
