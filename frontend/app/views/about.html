      <p>
        A computer programmer (Rob Colbert, me) has snapped. After two straight
        decades in software development, I decided end my permanent, full-time
        corporate experience. After more than a <strong>decade</strong> of
        fighting with various "IT Professionals" over this &amp; that at various
        companies, I decided to stop giving all fucks and changed the question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Why is this always a fight? Am I perhaps the one who
          is flawed in my constant pursuit of progress and innovation?
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        With this new mantra in mind, I've set off on a journey to find the
        answer. Pulsar <em>is</em> that journey. Today, the page you're reading
        is being served by Pulsar, an application of my own creation, atop the
        MEAN stack running in production without issues.
      </p>

    <h2><img src="favicon.ico" /> Project Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ship Pulsar Studio;</li>
      <li>Ship presentation updates to Pulsar Composer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><img src="favicon.ico" /> Adoption Goals</h2>
    <p>
      None. Use it if you want to. It's subject to change, quite early and might break if
      you use it in a way I didn't predict.
    </p>

    <h2><img src="favicon.ico" /> API Stack</h3>

      <a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a> and

      <a href="https://github.com/flatiron/winston">Winston</a> is used as the logger,
      <a href="http://www.nodemailer.com/">nodemailer</a> sends email and

      <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a> and
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> are used for scaffolding, builds, dependency
      maintenance and revision control, respectively.
    </p>

    <h2><img src="favicon.ico" /> Front-End Stack</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighttpd</a> is serving up a static
      <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> client through
      <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> as a CDN. All business logic is written in
      JavaScript and executes in the browser. The client is an HTML5 Single-Page
      Application that does not care about SEO.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>,
      <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>,
      <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>,
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a> and
      <a href="">git</a> are using for scaffolding, builds, project dependency
      maintenance (Bower and npm) and revision control, respectively.
    </p>

    <h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
    <p>
      Search is not my problem. It's Google's problem. Maybe Ask.com will be first
      to index SPA's? Who cares?
    </p>
    <p>
      AngularJS is Google's front-end framework. The potential for an automatic
      search solution is there, and is one of the main reasons I'm on Angular. If
      Google wants to index Pulsar's default client's presented content, they can
      figure that problem out. Or, I'll get to it, "Eventually." (read: Not likely
      any day soon at all, not on the roadmap).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to be using tech that stands up a heavily-optimized landing page
      per current expectations, WordPress or any solution that serves presented
      content is a much better option. Pulsar will eventually serve presented
      pages through Node.js as an <em>optional</em> configuration using Jade
      templates.

    <p>
      It's all running on one little VM in the cloud somwhere. But, it is
      <em>easily</em> broken out and scaled both horizontally and vertically at all
      tiers. MongoDB shards up nicely. Memcached pools as needed. Node.js gets
      ridiculous with multiple vertical instances per host and as many horizontal hosts
      as are required divided into high-availability and content-balanced pools as
      desired. In fact, I am looking forward to figuring out how to start
      <em>paying</em> for expanded levels of service profitably as or if demand grows.
    </p>

    <h2><img src="favicon.ico" /> Hosting</h2>
    <p>
      I'm building Pulsar, Pulsar Composer, Pulsar Studio and Constellation for free
      and giving them away. All of them. All features, end-to-end, no limitations and
      completely open source under the MIT license. That...has value.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be compensated, I am only asking not to host all of this as a public service
      for free. I can build it, but I need help affording the hosting. Scaled out
      hosting can only be afforded if provided by the community in some way. We'll
      figure it out when/if the time comes. Not worried. It scales. That's all I need
      to know (and I do) for now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm staying focused on feature development. It's not like I wanted to
      build a CMS and decentralized social network. I'm seriously just doing
      this to prove or disprove the underlying technologies in a peer-reviewable
      way.
