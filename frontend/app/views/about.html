    <h2>About Rob</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a freedom-loving individual living and working in Pittsburgh, PA, as a
      web developer. I build software that saves companies money and reduces our
      reliance on things like foreign oil as well as some other beneficial side
      effects. I've been a professional software developer since 1994, and I've
      been writing software since I was a child.

      <li>
        I was admitted into the Gifted and Talented Education (G.A.T.E.)
        program in 4th grade where I began learning to program on a Texas
        Instruments TI-99/4a. That was the world's first 16-bit personal
        computer, and I truly working up to writing video games in BASIC by 7th
        grade.

        I attended Carnegie Mellon University's Advanced Placement/Early
        Admission program as one of two students from the state of Pennsylvania
        in 1990 between my junior and senior years of high school.
      </li>

        I also didn't graduate with my high school class. I had to go to summer
        school and get my diploma that way.
      </li>
      <li>
        I then earned an Associates Degree in Computer Science from the
        Community College of Allegheny County.

      Here are some games I built during my 20-year career in the games

    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
      I built this site from scratch using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS,
      AngularJS and Node.js). The front-end application is being served to the
      browser by Apache httpd on Ubuntu 12.04. The back-end API is powered by
      Node.js also running on Ubuntu 12.04.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is my personal blog, thought engine (because Twitter sucks) and
      technological playground. As I want to explore new technologies and learn
      them inside and out, I work on them here to build a new version of my
      personal site.
