      <p>
        You ever feel like you're sitting in a meeting being asked to do
        something in a way for which you know a simpler way exists? Requests
        like using WordPress to build a dating site or perhaps using the
        joys of J2EE spanning Spring, Hibernate and a spendy Oracle database
        to build the simplest of CRUD apps? I get that feeling all the time.
        In a former life? Daily. And, yes...after a point...I'd had enough.

        I am a veteran computer programmer with over 20 years of experience in
        video games, low-level networking, systems and embedded software
        development. I've designed, written, implemented, tested, deployed
        and/or maintained systems in the domains of online games, backbone-grade
        network equipment, enterprise applications, educational software and
        training simulations. I've hand-built 2D and 3D graphics and
        presentation systems, audio processing and streaming libraries, entire
        online gaming systems and the tools to support them all.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've done these things in contributing, lead and architect roles since
        about 1994. I have been constantly learning to program computers since
        about 1987. And, I've <em>always</em> loved what I've gotten to do:
        Create. It's why I write code. The past ten years of my career, however,
        has been spent fighting non-stop with various "IT Professionals" over
        this &amp; that at various companies in my <strike>past</strike> wake.
        And, I eventually realized that I'm simply <em>too</em> advanced for the
        average IT Professional's comfort level.

            Would you believe I've been asked to create seven red perpendicular
            lines using green and transparent ink in the form of a kitten more
            than once in my career?

        I don't mind being above average. Perfectly acceptable. So, I've deicded
        to stop trying to succeed along that path, and have instead changed the
        <em>questions</em> I am asking. I've stopped asking, "How do I show them
        a better way?" or, "How do I stay sane here?" I've just stopped asking
        those. Today, I'm only interesting in knowing:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Why is this always a fight? Am I perhaps the one who is flawed in my
          pursuit of innovation?
        </p>

        With this new mantra in mind, I set off on a journey to find the answer.
        Pulsar <em>is</em> that journey. And, it's a personal journey in open
        source community membership, modern technology stacks and patience.
        Because today, the page you're reading is being served by Pulsar, an
        application of my own creation sitting atop the MEAN stack. And, it's
        running in production without issues. Ever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pieces of the MEAN stack such as MongoDB may not be the perfect tool for
        <em>every</em> job. True statement. But, I argue it is perfectly
        acceptable for use when I say it is. And, I argue that on the basis that
        the 20 years of experience known as, "Rob Colbert," has been doing the
        sort of shit you go home and dream and/or have
        <span class="quake">nightmares</span> about for all twenty of these
        years.

        I'm simply sick of having some "IT Professional" constantly trying to
        tell me how to do my job just because the words coming out of my mouth
        aren't: Oracle, MySQL and/or Java.
