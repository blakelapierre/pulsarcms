  <h2>SUMMARY</h2>

  <div class="section summary">
    <p class="text-justify">
      This version of my resume is hosted on Pulsar, my personal Content
      Management System. I built Pulsar using the
      <a href="http://mean.io/" target="_blank">MEAN stack</a>. And, I want
      to continue using MEAN to build cutting-edge, creative, web-based
      applications. I am also avaialble as a consultant to help you put Pulsar
      to work solving the tough challenges of making your web site easily do
      what you want it to do. If you'd like a custom feature built for Pulsar,
      would like help configuring it for massive scale or have some other need
      or idea, please get in touch!

      with a rockin' soundtrack and need some help doing it, or I'm probably

      Was hired to contribute to a Perl-based enterprise sourcing application.
      Was asked to replace its outdated and inappropriately priced back-end
      charting component with an HTML5 front-end component powered by Kendo UI's
      <a href="http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui-dataviz" target="_blank">DataVis
        Charts</a>. Upon successful delivery, I was asked to prototype an
      entirely new HTML5 reporting tool for the core application that would also
      serve as an evaluation and example for migrating and adapting the entire
      product.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the prototype, I selected and presented the MEAN stack as an approach
      so a two-person team could answer questions within our allotted six weeks.
      It was approved, development began and six weeks later the prototype was
      successfully delivered. MEAN was selected primarily for
      <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> on the
      front end and its peaceful integration with
      <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> (a design
      requirement),
      <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">ExpressJS</a> to rapidly
      build service endpoints,
      <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/" target="_blank">MongooseJS</a> for a
      manageable and maintainable data object layer and
      <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> for a combination
      of development ease and long-term performance, if necessary. I
      additionally leveraged
      <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a> and its
      <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular" target="_blank">generator-angular</a>,

      <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a> and
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ...in an svn house that had been using Perl atop MySQL under Apache on
      CentOS for over a decade without coming up for air. So, a lot of real
      confusion happened. And, because of an extremely high degree of
      misunderstanding based on, as I was told, "History here at the company,"
      along with a lack of proper messaging and communication, I decided SciQuest
      wasn't the right environment for me and left very quickly (in somewhat of a
      blur).
