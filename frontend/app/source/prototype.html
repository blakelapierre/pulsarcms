  <h1>Pulsar Prototype: SoundCloud Integration</h1>
  <p>
    Thank you for putting up with that bit of mayhem. But, what really excites me (Rob) is that
    I'm absolutely <em>not</em> the person who's going to create the best experiences on Pulsar.
    Because that's going to be you. I am best at writing the kind of code that makes things do
    things. And, well, the inventor of Poking with an unexpected Kanye West moment was the best
    I could whip up for this. Just trying to get your attention and make a few points.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, there is much JavaScript code behind this web page. But, you don't need to know how to
    do anything more than maybe a little math to create experiences just like this one. And, to
    prove it, <a href="#/prototype/source">here's the actual HTML code</a> running on this page
    (right now).
  </p>

  <p>
    If you know HTML and CSS (I've used a LOT of inline CSS to show HOW things are being done),
    then all of that should make some sense. It's not a simple sample, and it should give folks
    plenty to discuss. I'm not really paying attention. No time, actually. In less than one week,
    I hope anyone will be able to create Pulses that are this integrated with embedded SoundCloud
    and YouTube player content.

  <h2>How the ?</h2>
  <p>
    Okay, this isn't all that complicated. The SoundCloud player that anyone can embed
    in any web page anywhere exposes a JavaScript API. PULSAR simply uses that API to
    retrieve information about tracks on SoundCloud inside an AngularJS controller.
    Then, it provides a whole new HTML5 experience by leveraging the information exposed
    by SoundCloud to web programmers.
  </p>
  <p>
    AngularJS extends the HTML language with a whole new suite of elements, attributes
    and more that are intended to finally bring HTML up to par with modern web application
    design and development. By leveraging exactly these features along some clean best
    practices, I've been able to quickly and easily integrate <strong>all</strong> of the
    SoundCloud Widget API with AngularJS.
  </p>
  <p>
    The end result: Your HTML can actually respond to a piece of media playing on the
    page using AngularJS directives such as ng-show, ng-click, ng-src and more. Have a
    read of the source code for this page. You will be quite shocked to see just how
    simple it really was to build this experience on Pulsar.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please realize something: I am only getting started. This project is four weeks
    old, is being built on the MEAN stack and will soon be open sourced under the MIT
    license with a dowhatchalike policy. I've simply been very focused on achieving
    these goals with the software and genuinely just haven't taken the time to finish
    the documentation and get it online.
  </p>
  <p>
    And, I would have more time to do that if I had some help. But, I'm doing this
    entirely on my own. That's not by choice. I've asked for help. I just haven't
    received any responses. I either don't know the right place to ask for help, or
    I don't know how to correctly ask for help. And, I don't think I care anymore. If
    people want to get involved, awesome. If not, awesome.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks again for viewing this experience. It was a true pleasure to create. Now,
    I can't wait to finish the timeline-based editor for these :)

  <p>
    I'm just going to leave this here as a reminder that the population of the United
    States of America is not currently being represented by its own elected leadership.
    That leadership has gone completely off the rails, and we're trying to get things
    back under control. Give us a minute, okay? It's a big problem...
  </p>
  <p>
    We're right there with you: This President has <em>got</em> to go. For all the hope
    and change he sold us with words, he stole that and more through his disgusting
    series of actions in office. We hate him more than you do. But, we have a defunct
    Congress, Senate and Judicial Branch that have all been completely sold out to
    corporations and other highest bidders.
