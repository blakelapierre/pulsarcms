Starlight is a 3D audio visualizer hosted on Pulsar. It uses the Pulsar WebAudio
service to tap into a real time audio stream that is being analyzed. The
analysis data is consumed by the visualizer and used to alter the parameters of
a 3D representation (not simulation) of that data.

WAVEFORM:
The waveform display is accomplished with a particle system for which the
position of each particle is being controlled by the visulizer using time
domain audio "waveform" data. All 1024 audio sample points are being plotted
as discreet particles in three dimensional space, giving us a very unique
visual of the audio waveform stream itself.

The particles themselves appear to be lit by the Starlight because the light's
RGB color is being set to bass, mids and treble, respectively - and because
the material for rendering the sprites is having its color set to the exact
same color and intensity. Where the illusion would break down is when the
light moves very far away from the particles. This is why the waveform
display is quite large in the final stage.

It also gives the illusion that the particles are emitting light. So, I have
added a directional light to the scene positioned at the center of the
particle system "looking at" the text on display.

All I needed to read to know this would work was the Three.js ParticleSystem
docs:

ParticleSystem( geometry, material )
geometry — An instance of Geometry.
material — An instance of Material (optional).

And, about geometry:
An instance of Geometry, where each vertex designates the position of a
particle in the system.
